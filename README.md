Exam Project Description
For this project, the aim is to build a functioning website for VinKø, the new vintage clothing store that will open its doors soon in Copenhagen. For this website to function at launch, we as store owners decided that we should focus on some key features first and see how successful the website is, before we extend its features further. This is why we decided to design the website to first have a main landing page with a login function. The customer can decide if they want to make a new account, or if they would like to login as an ‘existing’ member of the VinKø community. If they have forgotten their password, we will make sure that they receive an email with a ‘reset my password’ link. This login feature is a key item, since it will enable users to schedule a clothing repair appointment with us in-store. An important thing to note is that only registered customers can schedule an appointment, so we can collect their data and keep track of the members of our community. By doing so, we could apply CRM tools like follow-up feedback emails in the future. Moreover, since we are building a community of VinKø shoppers, we would like to develop a section on which customers can leave us reviews and comments on their shopping experience. Moreover, customers will most likely have questions, which is why we will provide a FAQ section in which they can also ask us (anonymously - so without logging in first) a question via an online form built into the website. Because VinKø is all about creating a good customer experience, we would like to keep our customers and community members up to date with newsletters that they can sign up for via our website. Furthermore, we will also place a Google Maps integration and opening hours on our website to ease the navigation for our customers. Finally, we will place links to our own Instagram and Facebook pages on the website, for a multi social media channel experience.
